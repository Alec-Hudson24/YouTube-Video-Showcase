# YouTube-Video-Showcase

Description: I did an indoor drumline and every week I had to submit a video assignment, instead of just doing the video assignment I used this as an opportunity to help better my story telling, video editing, and photo editing skills. Below I have included a list of a few of my videos that highlight story telling and the skills I aquired.
